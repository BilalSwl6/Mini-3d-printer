## 10/15/2025 - Starting serach and learning how things works  

## Day 1 - 15 oct 2025

just saw how actually 3d works, how printer move things like base and arm to print object. start thinking how 3d world in going on. 
what I do:
- join onshape to design things and learn how to draw things (draw some basics things.
- learn about different filaments that used in printer
- how printer head works and how filaments melt to draw (even different colors)
- research on existing printer that are available in market and there features

### what next to do:
- draw a basic sketch on paper
- learn about stepper motor
- get informations for material that are easily available available for frame (also cost effective and reliable)
  

## 10/16/2025 - draw some drawings and learn about moters  

# Day 2 - 16-10-2025

today I do lot of things and draw some drawings (but I am so bad in this) and also try to figure-out material but still not finalize

my writing is bad, ignore it. I saw working of lot of Bambu-Lab printers. there is foundation is very strong and also provided extra feature (some of them are very advance). I just take inspiration while making design. its just my first drawing and also not final. its has many things that need to be explain and most of details are missing because I never try and never see any printer physically. 
I read about stepper motor and also how it work in steps. this concept is very interesting to move things with high precision. I also that these type of moter need a driver to give instructions. 
I also design some basics design in onshape to get control over.

### what's next: 
- design more and more complex things in onshape to become best.
- learn more about firmwares that used (ðŸ¤” not sure that I am saying) to control printer
a lot more....

sources that I used to get info: 
- YouTube (of course) {lifeada, Core Electronics, CAD Video Tutorials, ATO Automation, The Engineering Mindset ...}
- [Core Electronics](https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/digital-electronics/servos-steppers-or-solenoids-choosing-an-actuator-to-move-your-project/)  get more understanding 
- and some other that I check rendomly but get nothing spacial

that's for today, see you in next journal entry,
Goodbye  

## 10/22/2025 - explore a world of printer  

# Day 3 - 22-10-2025

What I learn (in previous two days)
- read about G and M code
- Learn about CNC
- first time about CoreXY
- read more about Cartesian coordinate system (already have knowledge but only for book problems, never think in practical things like this)
- Fused filament fabrication
- voron (about open source projects
- patents and trademarks (spacially about FFF)
- practice onshape CAD
- and much more....

these all tabs that I expored and some are still untouched that I will see tomorrow

before I only know about Bambulab, now I know about others that make open source such things that Bambulab make. I discard idea to things like Bambulab but now I know that they can have trademarks and patents that may lead to other things, so now I will only relay on public and open source.
read about all voron printer their works and main thing there cost to build.
I choose voron trident, because of cost, speed and duribility. I think I can make it. I also explore other like prusa but I think voron is best for me. I am not going to copy paste everything, its just to model because I never print any object so it will cause measurement issues so I will see voron trident design and other things that used. I will not include (extra) things that have no meaning on my stage. also explore all local market to find aluminium extrusion for frame but not succesd (now I need to visit online marketplace. I visit because I want reduce cost but failed)



## source that I used to learn:
these source used to learn about above things
- [1 Video by Teaching tech](https://www.youtube.com/@TeachingTech)
- [Wikipedia on G/Mcode, Cartesian and other topic that I see)
- [youtube](https://YouTube.com) I search a lot and watch for hours about printer assembling and other things

that's for today, 
Bye
